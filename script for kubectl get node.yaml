Sure! You can create a Linux shell script to execute the `kubectl get node` command. Here's an example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the kubeconfig file path
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/your/kubeconfig.yaml

# Execute kubectl get node command
kubectl get node
```

Save the above script to a file, such as `get_nodes.sh`. Make sure to replace `/path/to/your/kubeconfig.yaml` with the actual path to your kubeconfig file.

Make the script executable by running the following command:

```shell
chmod +x get_nodes.sh
```

You can then execute the script by running:

```shell
./get_nodes.sh
```

It will use the specified kubeconfig file to execute the `kubectl get node` command and display the node information on the console.
