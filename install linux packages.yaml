To install Linux packages using Ansible, you can use the `apt` or `yum` modules depending on your Linux distribution.

Here's an example of how to install a package using Ansible:

```yaml
- name: Install package using apt module
  apt:
    name: packageName
    state: present

- name: Install package using yum module
  yum:
    name: packageName
    state: present
```

Replace `packageName` with the name of the package you want to install. This code will ensure that the specified package is installed on the target system.

To execute this Ansible code, you need to create a playbook YAML file and run the Ansible command with the playbook specified:

```bash
ansible-playbook your-playbook.yaml
```

Make sure you have Ansible installed on the machine where you want to run this code.
