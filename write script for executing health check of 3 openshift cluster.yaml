Sure! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook to execute a health check on 3 OpenShift clusters:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute health check on OpenShift clusters
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    clusters:
      - name: cluster1
        url: https://cluster1.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
      - name: cluster2
        url: https://cluster2.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
      - name: cluster3
        url: https://cluster3.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890

  tasks:
    - name: Execute health check on clusters
      command: oc --config={{ item.url }} --token={{ item.token }} get nodes
      loop: "{{ clusters }}"
      register: result

    - name: Display health check results
      debug:
        msg: "{{ item.stdout }}"
      loop: "{{ result.results }}"
```

In this playbook, we define a list of clusters with their respective URLs and tokens. The `command` module is then used to execute the OpenShift command `oc get nodes` on each cluster using the provided URL and token.

The output from each cluster is stored in the `result` variable, and then we use the `debug` module to display the output for each cluster.

You can customize this playbook further based on your specific health check requirements or add additional tasks to verify other aspects of cluster health.

To execute this playbook, save it as a `.yaml` file (e.g., `health_check.yaml`) and run the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook health_check.yaml
```

Make sure you have Ansible installed on your machine before running the playbook.
