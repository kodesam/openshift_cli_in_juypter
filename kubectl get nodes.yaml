To get the nodes in a Kubernetes cluster using the `kubectl` command line tool, you can run the following command:

```shell
kubectl get nodes
```

This command will display a list of all the nodes in the cluster along with their status, roles, and other relevant information.

If you want to execute this command from a Python Jupyter notebook, you can use the `subprocess` module to run the shell command and capture the output. Here's an example:

```python
import subprocess

# Run the 'kubectl get nodes' command
result = subprocess.run(['kubectl', 'get', 'nodes'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Check if the command was successful
if result.returncode == 0:
    # Print the output
    print(result.stdout)
else:
    # Print the error message
    print(result.stderr)
```

Make sure you have the `kubectl` command line tool installed and configured properly to access your Kubernetes cluster before running this code.
