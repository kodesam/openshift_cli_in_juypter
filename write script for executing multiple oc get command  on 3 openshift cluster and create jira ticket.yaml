Sure! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook to execute multiple "oc get" commands on 3 OpenShift clusters and create a Jira ticket for each cluster:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute OC get and create Jira ticket for OpenShift clusters
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    clusters:
      - name: cluster1
        url: https://cluster1.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
        project: PROJECT1
      - name: cluster2
        url: https://cluster2.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
        project: PROJECT2
      - name: cluster3
        url: https://cluster3.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
        project: PROJECT3
    jira_server: https://your-jira-server.com
    jira_user: your-jira-username
    jira_pass: your-jira-password

  tasks:
    - name: Execute oc get commands on clusters
      command: oc --config={{ item.url }} --token={{ item.token }} get {{ item.oc_get_object }}
      loop: "{{ clusters }}"
      register: oc_get_result

    - name: Create Jira tickets
      uri:
        method: POST
        url: "{{ jira_server }}/rest/api/2/issue/"
        user: "{{ jira_user }}"
        password: "{{ jira_pass }}"
        headers:
          Content-Type: application/json
        body: |
          {
            "fields": {
              "project": {
                "key": "{{ item.project }}"
              },
              "summary": "OpenShift Cluster Health Check - {{ item.name }}",
              "description": "The output of the 'oc get' command is as follows:<br><br>{{ item.stdout }}",
              "issuetype": {
                "name": "Task"
              }
            }
          }
      loop: "{{ oc_get_result.results }}"
```

In this playbook, we define a list of clusters with their respective URLs, tokens, and Jira project keys. The `command` module is then used to execute the 'oc get' command on each cluster, and the output is stored in the `oc_get_result` variable.

Next, the `uri` module is used to create a Jira ticket for each cluster. You'll need to provide the appropriate Jira server URL, username, and password. The Jira ticket details, including the project key, summary, and description, are dynamically generated using the `oc_get_result` variable.

You can customize this playbook further based on your specific 'oc get' commands or modify the Jira ticket details as needed.

To execute this playbook, save it as a `.yaml` file (e.g., `oc_get_create_jira.yaml`) and run the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook oc_get_create_jira.yaml
```

Make sure you have Ansible installed on your machine before running the playbook.
