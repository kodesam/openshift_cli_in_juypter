In an Ansible playbook, you can use the `oc` module to interact with the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). Below is an example of how to use the `oc` module to get services in OpenShift:

```yaml
---
- name: Get OpenShift services
  hosts: localhost  # Assuming running the playbook on the Ansible control node

  tasks:
    - name: Use oc command to get services
      oc:
        command: get services
      register: output

    - name: Print output
      debug:
        var: output.stdout_lines
```

In this playbook, we first use the `oc` module with the `command` parameter set to "get services" to retrieve the list of services in OpenShift. The output of the command will be stored in the `output` variable.

Finally, we use the `debug` module to print the stdout_lines attribute of the `output` variable, which contains the list of services.
