Sure! Here's an example of an Ansible playbook to execute multiple health checks on 3 OpenShift clusters and send an email to the teams:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute and email health check report for OpenShift clusters
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false

  vars:
    clusters:
      - name: cluster1
        url: https://cluster1.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
      - name: cluster2
        url: https://cluster2.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
      - name: cluster3
        url: https://cluster3.example.com
        token: abcdefg1234567890
    email_recipients:
      - team1@example.com
      - team2@example.com

  tasks:
    - name: Execute health check on clusters
      command: oc --config={{ item.url }} --token={{ item.token }} get nodes
      loop: "{{ clusters }}"
      register: result

    - name: Generate health check report
      set_fact:
        health_check_report: "{{ health_check_report|default([]) + [item.stdout_lines] }}"
      loop: "{{ result.results }}"

    - name: Send email report
      mail:
        host: smtp.example.com
        port: 25
        subject: "OpenShift Health Check Report"
        body: |
          The health check report is as follows:
          {% for report in health_check_report %}
          Cluster: {{ report.0.item.name }}
          {{ report.0.stdout }}
          {% endfor %}
        from: health-check@example.com
        to: "{{ email_recipients }}"
```

In this playbook, we define a list of clusters with their respective URLs and tokens, as well as a list of email recipients. The `command` module is then used to execute the OpenShift command `oc get nodes` on each cluster using the provided URL and token.

The output from each cluster is stored in the `result` variable, and then we use the `set_fact` module to generate a health check report by appending the `stdout_lines` of each cluster to the `health_check_report` list.

Finally, the `mail` module is used to send an email report. You'll need to provide the appropriate SMTP server details (`host`, `port`) and configure the `from` and `to` email addresses. The subject and body of the email are dynamically generated using the `health_check_report` variable.

You can customize this playbook further based on your specific health check requirements or modify the email content as needed.

To execute this playbook, save it as a `.yaml` file (e.g., `health_check_email.yaml`) and run the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook health_check_email.yaml
```

Make sure you have Ansible installed on your machine before running the playbook.
