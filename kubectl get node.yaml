To create a Linux shell script that executes the `kubectl get node` command, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a text editor and create a new file.
2. Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Execute kubectl get node command
kubectl get node
```

3. Save the file with a name such as `get_nodes.sh`.
4. Make the script executable by running this command in the terminal:

```shell
chmod +x get_nodes.sh
```

5. Finally, you can run the script using this command:

```shell
./get_nodes.sh
```

This will execute the `kubectl get node` command and display the node information in the console. Make sure you have the `kubectl` command installed and properly configured to connect with your Kubernetes cluster.
