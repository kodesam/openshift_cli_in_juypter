There isn't a specific Linux command to find the latest movies. However, you can use online resources to get information about the latest movies. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `curl` command-line tool if you don't have it:
```shell
sudo apt-get install curl
```

2. Use the `curl` command-line tool to fetch movie data from an API or website that provides movie information. For example, you can use the OMDb (Open Movie Database) API:
```shell
curl -s "http://www.omdbapi.com/?s=latest&apikey=YOUR_API_KEY"
```
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key. You can obtain a free API key by registering on the OMDb API website. This command will retrieve a list of the latest movies.

3. Parse and display the movie data using tools like `jq` to process JSON output or `grep`, `awk`, and other Linux command-line tools to filter and format the result.

Note that the availability and usage terms of movie APIs or websites may vary, and you may need an API key or adhere to certain usage limits or terms of service.

Alternatively, you can visit popular movie websites or use movie listing platforms to get information about the latest movies. These websites usually provide up-to-date information about new movie releases.

I hope this helps you find the latest movies on Linux using the `curl` command!
