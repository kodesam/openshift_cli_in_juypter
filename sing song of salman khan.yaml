I'm sorry, but as a text-based AI language model, I don't have the capability to sing songs or play audio. However, you can use other tools or media players on your Linux system to listen to songs by Salman Khan. There are various media players available for Linux, such as VLC, Rhythmbox, Audacious, or specific command-line tools like `mpv` or `mplayer`, that you can use to play audio files or stream music.

To play an audio file or stream music using a media player on Linux, you can use a command like this:

```shell
vlc /path/to/salman-khan-song.mp3
```

Replace `/path/to/salman-khan-song.mp3` with the actual path to the Salman Khan song you want to listen to. Make sure you have the appropriate audio file or stream URL to play.

Please note that I am unable to provide specific audio files or URLs to Salman Khan songs due to copyright and licensing restrictions.

I hope this helps you listen to Salman Khan songs on your Linux system using a media player!
